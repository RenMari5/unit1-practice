                <p>Hi! My name is Renee Paczkowski, but you can call me Ren. I'm a bilingual HR professional, and my languages are English and Japanese.</p>
                    <h2 id="my-start">How I Got My Start</h2>
                    <p>Coding caught my interest as I became more and more familiar with the equipment and tech that I worked with on a daily basis while livestreaming on Twitch. Many of the friends 
                        I've made through streaming are in the Coding and Development world, and they really have sparked my continued interest in coding.</p>
                    <p>I chose Grand Circus for Bootcamp because I like the emphasis placed on diversifying the STEM workforce, and their commitment to the City of Detroit. Every interaction I've had 
                        with GC has been wonderful, thoughtful, and it is clear that everyone is passionate about the GC's goals. And now I am very excited to be even a small part of that.</p>
